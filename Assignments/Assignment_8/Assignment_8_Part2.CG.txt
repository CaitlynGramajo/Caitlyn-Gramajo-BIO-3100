##Part 2####
#Upload responses to the following as a numbered plaintext document to Canvas:

###Question 1####
#Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.

#All of the predictions make sense in context. They are all positive meaning that the plant is growing and not dying.

###Question 2####
#In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.

#Yes in the GrowthRate V Nitrogen plot a curve shows up indicating a non-linear relationship.

###Question 3####
#Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)

#copying over the non_linear_relationshop.csv to this project

data2<-read_csv("./non_linear_relationship.csv")
data2 %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=predictor, y = response))+
  geom_point(color="darkorchid3")+
  theme_minimal()

mod10<-glm(data = data2,
           formula = response ~ predictor)

boxcox_result<-boxcox(mod10)

lambda <- boxcox_result$x[which.max(boxcox_result$y)]

transformed_y <- if (lambda == 0) log(data2$response) else ((data2$response^lambda - 1) / lambda)

data3 <- data.frame(predictor = data2$predictor, transformed_y)

mod10.2 <- glm(data = data3,
               formula = transformed_y ~ predictor)
summary(mod10.2)

#The new linear model will be modeling the transformed variable as a response of the predictor x
